# FR2 Reborn

FR2 Reborn is a fan made, offline revival of Fun Run 2 for mobile, rebuilt to look, play and feel like the original game. Quick Play races against bots and player progress is stored on the device. Development of this game marks over 1.5 years of discontinuous development, from the project's creation in February 2025 to Release (October '26)!

## Features

* Quick Play races against bots, with map voting, coins, gems and league rating
* Practice races on every map, just for fun
* Weekly leagues from Wood to Elite, with divisions, prizes, promotions and player profiles
* Power up sets you can try in the lobby for a single gem
* The full shop: animals, skins, hats, accessories and power up skins
* Daily spin wheel, achievements and news
* The original tutorial, maps, themes and race results screen
> More to come soon, I won't mention it outright, but check discord in case you need updates!

## Platforms

* Android
* iOS
* PC (controls are Up, Down, Left, Right for Navigation, otherwise use Mouse. Space to Jump, X for powerups.)
> Download from [Releases](https://github.com/AaravGupta/FR2-Reborn/releases/latest)!

## Releasing Updates

The game save stays in the app's local Documents folder. To keep existing saves when publishing an update, keep the Android application ID and signing key, and the iOS bundle ID, the same as the previous release. Increase Android `versionCode` and iOS `CFBundleVersion` for every store upload; keep the displayed app version aligned in `build.settings` and `configuration.lua`. The app IDs and signing details are entered in Solar2D's build dialog and are not stored in this repository, so preserve the values from the previous release there. GitHub Actions is not needed; build and check each release in Solar2D.

Only increase `lua/modules/saveData.lua`'s save version when the stored save format changes, and add the corresponding migration before releasing that change. Do not delete or recreate `data.sqlite3` during an app update.
